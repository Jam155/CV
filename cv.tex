\section*{Projects}
\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
Kino Creative&{\bf Coastal Retreats -- Company Website}\\
&After another developer left Kino Creative I took over the managment and maintanance of this project. The client had a number of problems with search queries causing taking large amounts of time to return. It would also cause the site to hang during heavy usage. I successfully managed to analyse this and came to the conclusion database queries where causing the issue. After optimising the queries I reduced response times from 13 seconds to under half a second in most cases.\\
Kino Creative&{\bf Luxury Leisure -- Online Training Resource}\\
&Successfully developed a online e-learning application for Luxury Leisure - the app was a single page application that allowed Luxury Leisure to train new employees in areas such as Food Safety, and Underage Gambling. It brought their training resources up to date and has successfully increased engagement with material that mostly went unread.\\
Kino Creative&{\bf Zespoke -- WebGL Customiser}\\
&Created a 3D Customiser using WebGL for a client that sold bespoke furniture. The customiser allowed customers to see a visual representation of their choosen furniture. The customer could then change the colours of the table and add on options such as a glass shelf or table legs and this would be displayed on the visual representation. It also allows customers to move the table around to get a 360 degree view of the table. This has successfully increased engagement with the site.\\
\end{tabular}

\section*{Interests and Hobbies}
I enjoy taking part in Hackathons - two I've been involved with are DevXS and Ludum Dare. Group Roleplaying Games such as Dungeons and Dragons are an activity I enjoy. It allows me to get together with my friends and overcome interesting problems and challanges while having fun. I'm also a big fan of fantasy Books which have allowed me to gain experience to scenarios I would never usually come across.
